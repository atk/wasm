# Instruction append

## Input/Output format

The function receives a single string of words, each suffixed with a line break.

The first one is the word the remaining ones are supposed to be anagrams of.

Return a string of all valid anagrams, each suffixed by a line break.


## Reserved Addresses

The buffer for the input string uses bytes 64-319 of linear memory.

You may modify this buffer in place if you wish to avoid additional memory allocations.
