;; üëãüèΩ Hi there!
;;
;; On the Web Assembly track, we provide you with stubs. These stubs provide
;; a starting point to solving the exercise.
;;
;; Every exported global and function will have a WADoc (similar to JSDoc,
;; but for Web Assembly) comment block explaining what it is supposed to do.
;; The function signatures will also be provided.
;;
;; üí° You can remove those comments after reading them. They don't add value
;; to your finished solution. You can also remove the whole stub if you want.
;;
;; Good luck preparing some lasagna!
